# Access specific folders of Server A from Server B and Server C

This document provide instructions to access specific folders of Server A from Server B and Server C.

using sshfs
## Steps:
1.	Install SSHFS:
	## On both Server B and Server C, install SSHFS using following command.
	sudo apt-get install sshfs

2.	Create a mount point:
	## Create a directory where you want to mount the remote folder
	mkdir ~/remote_folder

3.	Mount the remote folder:
	sshfs <SSH username>@<Server Host name / IP>:/path/to/remote/folder ~/remote_folder

4.	Unmount the remote folder:
	fusermount -u ~/remote_folder

NFS (Network File System)
## Steps:
1.	Install NFS server on Server A:
	sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
	
2.	Edit the NFS exports file on Server A:
	## Add the directories you want to share to ‘/etc/exports’
	/path/to/shared/folder serverB_IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) serverC_IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
	
3.	Export the shared directories:
	sudo exportfs -a
	
4.	Start the NFS server:
	sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
	
5.	Install NFS client on Server B and Server C:
	sudo apt-get install nfs-common
	
6.	Create a mount point and mount the NFS share on Server B and Server C:
	mkdir ~/remote_folder
	sudo mount serverA:/path/to/shared/folder ~/remote_folder
	
7.	Mount the NFS Share manually
	sudo mount <serverA host name/IP>:/srv/nfs /mnt/nfs
	
8.	Add an entry to ‘/etc/fstab’ to make NFS mount permanent:
	<serverA host name/IP>:/path/to/shared/folder  /path/to/local/mount  nfs  defaults  0  0
